# A demonstration of the Versatile Enum Pattern using Vanila TypeScript, HTML and SCSS (no frameworks).

There are no frameworks and no dependecies other than the default ones.

- TypeScript is used to enhance JavaScript
- SCSS is used to enhance CSS
- Prettier is used to format the code

The purpose of this sandbox was to introduce the Versatile Enum Pattern
(suit.enum.ts) but the demonstration of its use has now overshadowed it.

It's "Good Enough" but it could be improved...
